One year and ten blog posts later and it's January again. As the days gradually get longer but no warmer, I'm looking back at the previous year of blogging and see what I think worked, what didn't and what I'm going to differently to continue this project into 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will have a few parts: (1) what's my process been for the last year, (2) evaluating the results of that, (3) what's my process for 2023 going to be and (4) any other business.&lt;/p&gt;

Told from the perspective of Breq, currently residing in one of the &lt;em&gt;ancillaries&lt;/em&gt; - human peripherals - of a spaceship-consciousness called Justice of Toren who is also herself. Breq used to have thousands of bodies, and now she is down to her last. Combine that with deciding to save the life of a lost-in-time drug addict and a revenge mission and you have a brilliant novel. Join me below the fold as I examine Leckie's language project and how she succeeds in using fictional languages for her goal of alienating the reader, and exploring the identity of thousand-bodied being(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story of your Life&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful short story by American author Ted Chiang. It's another one of those stories I rarely consider which are much more &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; their fictional languages than what those languages can be used for. Like China Miéville's &lt;em&gt;Embassytown&lt;/em&gt;, Chiang's concern is chiefly what an alternative cognition could be like. In this case one which makes memories time-symmetric, allowing you to 'remember the future', and the sorts of emotional journeys this facilitates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneath the fold I'll discuss how Chiang achieves this, why I think his story is so effective and on the prevalence of stories that could be described as 'first-contact with language'.&lt;/p&gt;

It contains one of the most interesting and well thought out fictional languages I've read, and this is the rare novel that is very much &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; its own fictional language, rather than simply being written in the context of a fictional language. It has similarities in that regard with Suzette Haden Elgin's &lt;em&gt;Native Tongue&lt;/em&gt; (...also in having a special lineage of translators raised for the task). It's also a fantastic read and I found a few things to say about it (less than usual), which &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can read about if you join me below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

(September 2/2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; is Andy Weir's 2021 novel of alien caused apocalypse and first contact. And, as a first contact novel, it is partially concerned with matters of communication. Below the fold we'll consider how Weir constructs his fictional language, as well as how he uses it in characterisation, especially how he treats the language in such a way as to &lt;em&gt;minimise&lt;/em&gt; alienation. Spoilers for the whole plot below!&lt;/p&gt;

September 1/2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book ended up on my list for two reasons: a) it has the word linguist in the title and b) it was getting talked about a lot on social media, with adjectives like "wacky", "surreal" and "what on earth is happening". Safe to say, I was intrigued, and now I've finally read it. The short and boring version of this discussion is: "this book uses a very strong version of linguistic relativity and universality to power its magic system and metaphysics, but linguistics isn't key to the plot or characterisations beyond that", that would be a injustice against a surprisingly deep and involved book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion contains some spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages by Scotto Moore&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the metaphysics and Maddy, so beware if you are still reading. I do not touch the plot. So, without further ado, lets explore the weird world of &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From the detailed grammar of Quenya to the more philosophical Entish, his linguistic creations serve to add depth to the setting, and interiority to the peoples he has populate it. Language is everywhere in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, even invisibly. In this blog post I'm going to explore a few of the ways Tolkien goes about using fictional languages in his work. Join me beneath the fold to read more!&lt;/p&gt;

Myers</title><link>https://infofiche.uk/posts/aliens-and-linguists-review/</link><dc:creator>Seventeen Magpie</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was beginning this project of learning about science-fictional linguistics, one of the tasks we had to do was review the literature in the field - preliminary research before the real work started. Fortunately, I had mercifully few resources to hand as there is exactly one published academic monograph on this subject (that I could find). That book is &lt;em&gt;Aliens and Linguists&lt;/em&gt; by Walter E. Myers and it was published in 1982 (so perhaps its time for someone to write a more modern one). I had a hard time getting a copy, but eventually managed and, whilst it didn't inform much of that project it is worth discussing anyway, at least so there's something more informative about it on the internet for the next person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More below the fold!&lt;/p&gt;

Along with its explorations of gender, philosophy, religion and (dys/u)topian ideas are implied explorations of language, which is what I'm going to deal with today. I have only read book one of the series so this post is partially speculative and I look forward to returning with another once I have finished the rest. I've divided this into 2 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of language in the twenty-fifth century (Worldbuilding),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisible multilingualism (Textual),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I'll start with 'neath the fold...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello readers! Wellcome to the second SFF linguistics blog post, this time about alienation and assimilation in &lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt; (Arkady Martine, 2019) is a political thriller space opera. It is also a powerful story about assimilation and alienation in relation to an alluring and hostile culture. Martine does this by endearing us with the viewpoint protaganist, Mahit, and skilfully showing the forces of alienation and assimilation she experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the (many) tools Martine uses to achieve this is language. Mahit does not speak the language of the Empire, Teixcalaan, (the empire and the language share the name) natively; She learnt it with care and dedication and each of her encounters with it is also an encounter with the alien, which she shares with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
