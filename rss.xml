I'm Seventeen Magpie and I'm taking this post to outline my plans for the coming year and establish some things. It's mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this is actually the second post. I've already put out a discussion of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://infofiche.uk/posts/alien-language-in-barrier-by-vaughan-and-martin/"&gt;language barriers in *Barrier*&lt;/a&gt; so you can read that already. That is the kind of thing this blog is concerned with - SFF and linguistics and how they are used to tell stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I've started a list of 'has reads'. It's available on the sidebar. I'm deliberately not reviewing every book on there because I won't enjoy doing that. The list is mostly for my own interest to see what I read, when, how much &amp;amp;c. but I expect it will be useful if you're wondering - ever - 'has Seventeen Magpie read X?' and it can save you asking me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, I have a tenuous plan for what posts you have coming up (not in this order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How fictional languages are used in &lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt; to explore assimilation and alienation,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neopronouns in &lt;em&gt;A Half Built Garden&lt;/em&gt; (when that book comes out),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start of a theory series where I outline my approach to fictional language based criticism and establish key terms,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A love letter to &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, timing. I'm going to aim for a post a month, so you've had your post for February and the next one - probably from that list but I haven't decided which - will come around the start of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you then! Take care.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>infofiche</category><guid>https://infofiche.uk/posts/infofiche-update/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Language Barriers and Aliens in Barrier</title><link>https://infofiche.uk/posts/alien-language-in-barrier-by-vaughan-and-martin/</link><dc:creator>Seventeen Magpie</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rancher and an illegal immigrant find themelves stranded on an alien spacecraft, their own language barriers dwarfed by that they have with their captors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrier is a comic by Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin, with Muntsa Vicente. It is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/barrier"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; (pay what you want!) and its well worth a read for when my descriptions are sub-par. The thing that caught my eye, aside from it being an "unconventional drama about violence, language and illegal immigration," was the fact its a Spanish/English bilingual comic, and since I can read Spanish, I decided to give it a go. Spoilers beyond!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventeen Magpie. A significant number and noun. Going with the theme of the blog, until I come up with a better pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
