### Abstract:


### Notes:
#### Introduction:
So there's Darwin who we all know and love. Then there's his bulldog Huxley (Thomas H.) who took the view stressing *competition* and who was belligerant to Kropotkin. As a result of Huxley's very popular lectures and his strong oration, combined with the fact that that particular interpretation of natural selection resonated with the Manchester school of laissez faire(?) economics meant that interpretation became the dominating one.

Kropotkin instead sought to stress the importance of mutual aid. 

The opposition to non-competitive interpretations of evolution bears some similarity, apparently, to the church's dogmatic opposition to evolution in the first place.

Then the introduction descended into the usual anarchist critique of capitalism that comes with all leftist-published volumes.

There are two meanings to "competition" in Darwin's *Origin*: A metaphorical sense of the struggle for life against against the weather, the food supply, disease &c. and in a literal sense of a struggle for life against your fellow organisms, snatching the food from their mouths so that they might live.

This latter sense was (over)emphasised by Huxley and his followers partly because it lined up with their Malthusian//Victorian free-market whatever economics, but Darwin did not emphasis it to that extent.

#### Mutual Aid Amongst Animals
So the conception of this book was Kropotkin and his friend reading Darwin, getting very excited and going into the Siberian wilderness looking to see competition between animals of the same species, the fittest winning and being able to reproduce and so on. But they did not. Because the Siberian wilderness is *so* hostile to life anyway, any animal species that has internal competition between its members will fail, because it can't afford to compete. Siberia will kill it.

Instead, what they observed, was animals within species going to the greatest lengths to *aid* each other to succeed against the Siberian wilderness. Examples of such mutual aid include herd behaivor, migratory flocks, returning to the same nests every year, communal rearing habits and so on. Inter-species cooperation also demonstrates this to a greater extent. Indeed, on sheer numbers, prey outnumbers predators to a massive extent, because mutual aid *is* the better evolutionary strategy (though such mutual aid is also present within predator species).

It is as though the rule of nature is *not* a war of each against all but rather the avoidance of such a war through social impulses. This is how species get to evolve.

Okay, you may say, that is all well and good for Siberia where food is scarce and competition is suicidal, but what about in that English hedgerow which so provoked Darwin, in such instances of *abundant* resources is where natural selection by individual competition really present.

Kropotkin refutes you here also! I have forgotten how. Oh yeah, even in such cases, individual competition is *still* detrimental to the health of the species. In a hedgerow with co-operating birds and one without, those with co-operative birds will win because they manage to avoid competition. There will be a greater increase in their numbers, more reproduction or w/e.

(oh also there was a fun argument against Malthusianism in that brith rates are not all. even if birth rates suggest "too many" organisms are being born, that is not the same as an increase in the number of mouths you need to feed because many of those newborn organisms will die due to non-individually-competitive forces - weather, disease, and so on.)

We can also see that the promotion of sociable impulses is the key result of natural selection because, considering the only other chance to be periods of extreme hardship such as droughts then the animals that survive are not the fittest in any usual sense but pretty much those that survive are selected at random either due to random mutations or to circumstance. Additionally they will probably survive with some losses to their health via epigenetic factors (obvs Kropotkin didn't refer to those).

#### Mutual Aid Amongst "Primitive" Peoples
(What Kropotkin very unexcellently calls savages).

Humans are animals just like every other animal, and we can see that we have very well developed sociable impulses - additionally we are very poorly equipped to fight... bears or whatever. Mammoths. Thus our sociable impulses are key distinguishing factor. "Sociable ape".

Also you can do the usual anthropologist thing of going "human psychology is unchanged over time" (reasonable) so that if we can find present day humans in (more) similar material conditions to pre-historic human then we can infer their behavior is similar to that of pre-historic humans.

Tbh this whole chapter was very racist and not fantastic. Usual Victorian anthropology shit.

Basically lots of examples of how well developed primitive peoples' justice systems are and their family systems and so on. Emphasising their sociability and how they share all resources and practice mutual aid.

#### Mutual Aid Amongst Barbarians 
Okay this one was also weird but he wrote that the non-Roman "barbarians" of Europe were Asian immigrants from long ago? I mean... technically true but so were the Romans. This didn't make any sense and it's BS.

Anyway, once he mercifully stops talking anthropology. He gets onto describing the archeological evidence for mutual aid and egalitarian living amongst these various barbarian peoples. Stuff like the destruction or burial of grave goods, common land, common agriculture and so on. Also used present-day peasant populations as identical material conditions and so a valid comparison.

Largeish is section on their reconstructed justice systems with eye-for-an-eye mutually enforced. His argument is that the sociable impulse is very well developed in humans, and the tendency to mutual aid is visible in all places.

> [!Note] "Evolution"
> Kropotkin is interpreting "evolution" in a classically Victorian sense including the evolution of a civilisation from one "stage" of development to the next. Evolution between "stages" of "race" (which he starts calling 'stems' for some (Golden Boughs?) reason) and also evolution in the sense we'd recognise it as via natural selection.

> Anyway that's why so little of the book is actually concerned with animals. He's writing in an anthropological magazine.
