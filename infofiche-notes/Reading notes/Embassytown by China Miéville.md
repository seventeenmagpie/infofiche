I know he wrote this in response to Suvin's views on fantasy. Here's some sentences I noticed on my reading of Suvin that I thought might be problematic.

"SF is as opposed to supernatural or metaphysical estrangement as it is to naturalism or empiricism"

Gee Suvin really goes hard on fantasy being non-cognitive, IE, he proposes that fantasy is *not* about thinking about the world in a way a) consistent with Marxist tradition (Miéville is a Marxist) and b) cognitive. You can read my [[@suvin_1979]] notes to see what that means. He's very mean about fantasy being like, a diversion from the real work of SF, and criticises heavily SF works that might take the trappings of fantasy or veer into mythological logic rather than being more cognitive.

So I wrote all that before actually reading Embassytown, which is not fantasy but in fact science fiction written in the most classical of styles, though with more modern sensibilities. 

It matches how Suvin describes classic/good SF with its multiple novum explored deeply and cognitively.

I think the fundamental concept in Embassytown is that of pairs, but not in a binary opposition way more of there being two of something which makes the whole:
- Cut and Turn voices,
- The Ambassadors,
- Scile/Avice,
- (Other relationships),
- Truth and lies (okay that one is a binary opposition),
Bad things invariably happen when a pairing is broken or otherwise damaged - that's what the Ariekei addiction stems from. Ambassadors not being a proper pair causes problems for both, though that has to be enforced by a system of coercion. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Normally I say "the author used a fictional language to do such and such", but here it seems Miéville just wanted to use the fictional language for its own sake, as the core novum of his novel. My analysis isn't really prepared for that!

He (obviously) uses it to alienate, he puts a lot of words into explaining how different and incomprehensible Language is, and how normal humans are fundamentally incapable of speaking it. The emotional and politico-conflict arc of the novel consist in overcoming this alienation, but I feel wrong in saying the novel is about anything other than this weird Language.

He uses it to explore ideas about the philosophy of language by creating a language that is invariably true, what happens? Well you have people who can't lie, can't tell stories. They go out of their way to create similes "irl" so that they can say something is like this thing which exists (which can be true), which they couldn't say if that thing didn't exist (because then it would be a fiction, a lie). They can't use metaphor (until they are taught to, but this is clearly described as a change from Language).

Strongest linguistic relativity seems to hold for the Ariekei for most of the novel, but there is a tension in this. Their workarounds the limitations of their language, and their awareness of them, implies thought beyond what is capable of being expressed in language. Is it possible for an Ariekei to say "it is impossible to talk about X" and then describe X? I don't think so. Can they say "this sentence is false", probably not. Gee if EzCal said that they'd probably all explode.

Avice describes her work as teaching them to think, implying that what they do with Language isn't really thinking but rather... creation? The idea is they can't say anything that doesn't exist, so they can't think. So Language *is* thought, but this is debated and stressed over the course of the novel, until eventually Avice teaches them a language which is not thought. 

Apparently in Language referent and reference are the same, though this is clearly not true. $\frac{bird}{bird}$ clearly isn't a bird. (Hahahah, that's how they typeset Ariekei too.) In language, all referents refer to a concrete thing in the world. Can they say here? Are there dietics (we know they don't have 'that').

Can an Ariekei speak to itself using only one voice at a time, can Cut talk to Turn?
