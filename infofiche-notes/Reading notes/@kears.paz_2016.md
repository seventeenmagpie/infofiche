# Medieval Science Fiction
## Foreward
In which medieval attitudes to science are discussed. I get the sense this chapter is inserted for the lay reader or non-medievalist scholar since it discusses a lot of things that are widely known to people in the field (and thus, things I don't know! yay).

Fun fact: it has happened that medieval surgical instruments are misidentified as tools for torturing instead! ("Pope's Pear" is actually an (icky) way to help excise anal fistulae).

*The Dream of Scipio* was an important text for preserving Greek science for a medieval audience.

Science was proper to study, as long as one didn't profit from it.

Standard course of education was the quadrivium, outlined in *The Marriage of Philology to Mercury* which is allegorical with npmyhs for each of the seven subjects wooing people. These subjects were:
- Grammar,
- Rhetoric,
- Logic, (these three form the trivium)
- Arithmetic,
- Music,
- Geometry,
- Astronomy, (these four form the quadrivium)

Belief in the physicality of hell as a place in the centre of the Earth (furthest from the heavens).

Aristotlian mechanics: four elements (earth, air, water, fire) each of which a combination of hot&cold, dry&wet. Like wants to go to like, so heavy things are more Earthlike and want to fall to the Earth. There was Earth, then water around it, then air around that, then fire on the outside (that's why flames go up, you see). All things made from combinations of the four.

Several theories of matter:
- Aristotlian one, as above,
- Alchemical, everything is really mercury modified by one or more tinctures,
- Heretical atomism.
The Aristotlian critique of alchemy is the underlying substance can't be changed, alchemists just change the aspect. Thus alchemical gold is fraud! Note to self: Do not accept coins from alchemists.

And from elemental metaphysics we get to geography. Pliny divided the world up into five, and this was preserved in *Scipio's Dream*. Up was cold, down was hot, east was dry, west was wet. In the middle (...hey that's where Rome is) was just right. This is where proto-racism comes from!

People believed the extremes were uninhabitable, but that didn't stop them adventuring or imagining themselves adventuring and then writing books (sometimes fictional) about it. Bestiaries were compended from common/classical knowledge. These were non-fiction works, written to try and work out how God's mark fitted in with all the weird stories people had about animals/creatures including ones the Ancient Greeks left like dog-headed people and what not. Christian authors added alegorical interpretations. Herbals the same.

Medieval pharmacology often worked okay for the time, but that's survivorship bias and they missed more than they hit. It proceeded blindly and empirically. (And the herbal books were more wrong than the folk healers).

Though there were professional medics. They weren't very good. Galen and four humours and so on.

Astrology also played a role in telling you the best time to carry out a treatment. Planets were closer and so had a stronger influence apparently.

Medieval people believed the cosmos to be huuuuuuuge and past the moon (the sphere where the fire is) there to be a fifth element of the cosmos; the ether.

(My paraphrase) "The medieval universe was coherent, purposeful, and filled with meaning. It made philosophical and logical sense. People had a 'scientific' understanding of it much like we do of our own universe (but less accurate). They also used this [[@suvin_1979#Estrangement and Cognition|cognitive metaphysics]] as a setting for their stories. Thus we can talk about medieval science fiction."

## Introduction: Medieval Science Fiction: An Impossible Fantasy?
By Carl Kars and James Paz
### Science Fiction in the Medieval Ages
Most SF crit ignores or dismisses the medieval period, either by tying sf too closely to modern science or simply through ignorance or disinterest. They say: "well science didn't exist, so neither could science fiction" and sometimes even go "ah, but ancient greek epics qualify as science fiction, sometimes"  Medievalists are unhappy about this.

Tho a better definition, like [[@suvin_1979]]'s cognitive estrangement or a 'knowledge fiction' definition about "engaging with and innovating on contemporary epistemologies" (which the authors call novel in 2015)... long after Suvin.

An example of Medieval science fiction is *Wonders of the East* which we also find in Old English as *Alexanders Letters to Aristotle* which describe Alexander's fictional adventures in India and all the weird and interesting things he sees there, which he reports back to Aristotle to help inform his teacher. These stories engange with the medieval understanding of the world, including lots of weird things like the truth-telling trees of sun and moon and nicors.

Roger Bacon was a cool medieval scholar who applied the empirical method of Ibn al-Haytham to Aristotle's works and found *that they disagreed with observation*. That's so cool.

Medieval writers imagined both positive and negative consequences of *scientias*. e.g., Bacon imagined flying machines and submarines, a guy called Conrad Kyeser imagined better weapons ("positive"), whilst Chaucer imagined an alchemist being turned into a lead automaton. Much like sf of all times tbf.

The story of the Seven Sleepers could be set to contain time-travel, or something whose literary effects are very similar, someone sleeping for hundreds of years to awake in a new period. 

Aliens! There were some medieval green people. "between 1135 and 1189 a girl and a body with green skin and speaking an alien tongue were found in the pits" near Woolpit. This story was widespread and "poses questions for genre history and race and identity".

And why shouldn't we include such things in medieval sf? Modern sf has escaped a clumsy reliance on science after all (if there ever was one).

There are many parellels between medieval travalogues and modern planetary romances. John Mandeville wrote a medieval travelogue in and around India and China. He described those dog-headed people again, but also considered their society and thought. He's doing the sf thing of thinking through the differences between humans and other living beings.

Using deliberately anachronistic readings of medieval texts ("aliens", "time-travel", "spaceships") can provoke one to ask unexpected and questions about medieval culture. It can also help us understand science fiction more broadly.

### Middle Ages in Science Fiction
Well, fantasy is *clearly* related to the Middle Ages, but mostly because people assume the middle ages were ages of magic and religion. That and the fact Tolkien was a medievalist.

But what about fantasy where magic can be rationalised, like in Le Guin (which?) or Jack Vance, and what about those who write magic as technology?

The most notable work of middle ages in science fiction is in C. S. Lewis' sf trilogy.

Translating medieval texts and writing sf both require visualising supernatural phenomena, but also imagining events for those gaps or absences created by a lack of historical information.

Dying Earth stories often involve technologically advanced society regressing back to a medieval-like state, like in Book of the New Sun.

Most sf works use 'medieval' in a negative, progressivist sense to contrast with the scientifically-advanced societies they are normally concerned with. This influences people's reductionist interpretations of the real, historical medieval era.

On the other hand, sf can provide a new and exciting way of understanding the middle ages.

### Making Medieval Science Fiction
The task is world building from genuine medieval sources rather than recieved information or 'what everybody knows' (the latter two being what world-building normally uses).

What does science-fiction studies have to gain? Legitimacy in an academy which sidelines it compared to "more important" literary fiction.

What does medieval studies have to gain? A means to prevent the propagation of reductionist and wrong views of the medieval period within sf.

This collection considers medieval/science/fiction in various permutations and verbs. It seems really cool!

After all, 14 contributors would not write more than 100,000 words about something not very important (paraphrasing Tolkien: "It is, one would have said, improbable that such a man would write more than three thousand lines (wrought to a high finish) on a matter that is really not worth serious attention".)

Whoo, pictures follow! Woah. Cool pictures. esp. of Alexander using a submarine and flying machine (four griffins chained to a littern with a box on top. Alexander steers by poking rabbits on sticks out the top in the direction he wants to go).

## Is *Beowulf* Science Fiction?
By Daniel Anlezark

The short (and correct) answer to this question is no, however it's an interesting idea to see how Beowulf engages with the science of its time.

Firstly, the author criticizes the extent to which Beowulf can even be called a Germanic epic, since there is nothing else similar in the entire corpus. There are saga cycles, but those... aren't the same. They aren't a cohesive narrative. The closest thing we have a record of is the versified bible stories, like Genesis A, which the Beowulf poet references several times.

It has more in common with the Aeneid or Oddesey, which the poet can't have been familiar with. So it's an epic poem because we decide to call it one, and not because the poet was aware they were writing an epic. Okay.

### The Science in Beowulf
In Beowulf the creation story is stated plainly: "in the beginning God created the heavens and the earths and populated the earth will all manner of living things". The plainless of this statement is remarkable when contrasted with other tellings, e.g., in Ælfric's homilies which take an immediately symbolic bent and join it up with Jesus to make it immediately theologically relevent. In this case, the Beowulf poet is simply stating it as a piece of scientific fact.

This reminds me of how sff authors begin their works with "the world was on the back of a tortoise" or "the universe began, much regarded as a bad idea" as a sort of glib assertion that keys the reader in to the story. Introduces it (in those cases introduces it as comedic 'cos I couldn't think of other examples). I wonder if it could have had a similar effect on Beowulf's contemporary readers.

Ælfric's spiritual intepretation contrasts with Bede's three centuries earlier, where Bede is much more concerned with the mechanics of creation, its initial simulteneity and so on. He writes of allegorical sense as a distraction from manifest truth!

The Beowulf poet doesn't mention the six days. This *could* be a result of ignorance, or simply disinterest. But it could *also* be the poets summary of a scientific theory; Bede's that all creation happened at one instant. He has the results of the days (people, trees, life) all in the same bit.

When Bede discusses the origin of evil, he has to explain the origin and meaning of the word "giant" whereas, a few centuries later, the Beowulf poet borrows that word without explaining it; it is known.

And both Bede and the Beowulf poet *don't* explain why Cain-descended giants weren't destroyed in the deluge. (At this point I think Beowulf is just showing how Early English scholasticism travelled surprisingly far).

Beowulf also resides in manuscript with Wonders/Alexander's Letter, does it imply both could be read for their 'scientific' interest. The poem also has similarities with beastyries.

Finally the presence of monsters in Beowulf is consistent with medieval 'scientific' accounts of giants and monsters; that they used to be populous until replaced by humans, that they have been driven into the seas, caves, grottos and so on and that, still, they inexplicably turn up. This is the setting for Beowulf. (imo that makes it realistic fiction?).

So it is consistent with medieval theories (which one could call scientific) about how the world works. Is that a surprise? Not really. And would I call those theories scientific? i wouldn't but I can see why someone would.

### Melting Ice
"Beowulf is a wet poem". Quote of the book.

Poet refers to the medieval theory of ice formation; God binds water into solid form (which is ice, but also gemstones and other crystals). This also occurs in The Wanderer apparently.

Other "illogical" things in Beowulf (such as sea monsters in freshwater meres) can be explained by reference to ealier medieval 'scientific' fact; such as Bede's theory that because God gathered up *all* the waters in Genesis, all the lakes and seas and oceans must be joined up, however secretly (this is 'proven' by how wells are dug - there are waters all under the Earth). This idea was probably common knowledge for the Poet to use.

The poet is still writing fiction and having fun being fantastical but, 'when it comes to it, medieval scientific fact trumps epic fiction.'

## The Future is a Foreign Country: *The Legend of the Seven Sleeepers* and the Early English Sense of the Past
By R. M. Liuzza

Starts by asserting medieval science fiction cannot exist, but the question justifies an exploratory approach. Discusses time-travel.

Wells invents his time machine by analogy with a car. Firstly, time is a dimension as widely understood, so its like distance. A car lets you move through distance much faster than you do normally, and a time machine does the same for time. And can go backwards.

This is in contrast to earlier time travel stories (Bellamy's *Looking Backwards* and Morris' *News from Nowhere* which [[@suvin_1979]] also discusses) which are set in the future and whose method of time travel is simply oversleeping.

The machine implies a mastery of artifice over time, whereas these earlier sleeping stories - here's a good quote: "Long sleepers surrender mastery, and agency, and even awereness, to lie outside the flow of time and allow it to pass by unnoticed. They are not time's Argonauts but time's victims, or its refugees." Sleeper stories contain a more elastic, internal or subjective sense of time.

There is a long and somewhat uninteresting history of such stories, way back into antiquity.

The Legend of the Seven Sleepers is a Christian miracle play in which seven pious Christians are being persecuted by an emperor named Decius (little relation to the actual Emperor)  and take refuge in a cave which they sleep in. Decius has it bricked up. Someone finds the cave 200 years later and when they knock down the wall the sleepers wake up, one goes into town to buy bread and gets arrested for using too-old money. The lot of them get bought before the bishop, the miracle is revealed, God is good &c. &c. and they go back to their cave and sleep until the end of time.

The Old English version is an adaptation, not translation, of the Latin and makes a number of changes. It's much more vivid and natural apparently. The point of the source was to scare against the heresy denying the bodily resurrection at the End of time.

It is sometimes said that medieval people lacked a sense of historical scale or anachronism. This is evident in the way they have classical figures act like medievals, the way they attribute the great works of the past to giants and otherwise imagine the past was like the present, but grander. Alternatively they might divide all time into three theological epochs due to a lack of reference point (which Bede innovated on using A.D. and B.C.). Everything that happens in the same epoch is the same time really.

And Early English historical poetry fosters a cultural identity based on a shared glorious past (really?). There are ideas that the past is still going on, that it is still inhabited.

This limited undestanding of time is partly supported by the story; it takes place in generic long-ago time under a generic bad emperor. And it has the sums wrong for how long the people slept.

HOWEVER the poem contains a really strong emotional sense of time passing. The Sleeper's first response on waking is one of wonder at how things have changed. Most notably that there are holy crosses everywhere. I just read the passage, it says wundor an awful lot and talks about how he can't recognise the city like anyone who had never seen it before.

Malchus (the waker) is also an object of wonder. The story is all about the power of the passage of time to bring about change; how it can completely displace someone and how profoundly destableizing that is.

What solves the riddle about who this man is is the coins in his pockets. The story is careful to explain when the coins were minted, and by what factors the proportion of silver decreased over time, and how many years it had been. Then the reeve arrests Malchus on suspicion of discovering an ancient hoard. This is a peculiarly Early English addition to the story, and archeological evidence suggests this system of repeated remintings was present in England at the time, and so familiar to the audience of the story. "old coins become portable ruins".

Then the story describes the past they came from, namely the percution of these Christians in grisly detail. "The past is not represented as a place of ethnic origin or a site for construction of tradition and identity [isn't it constructing a tradition of christian martydom?]. Past and future are mutually incomprehensible, unrecognizable, strange, dangerous."

Liuzza then contrasts the Christian and Heroic sense of pasts; in the former the past was a place of terror and persecution and history travels forwards towards greater perfection culminating in the second coming or w/e. In the latter, the past is a somewhat glorious place which has been moved on from, but intrusions from it into the present can be disasterous (Malchus e.g., or the cup that wakes the dragon in Beowulf).

The story of the seven sleepers demonstrates that the early english did have a strong sense of the progression of time, and used such as narrative devices in vernacular storytelling. Also it fits in with Augustine's conception of time, seeing as the sleepers are always asleep residing in the present and ignorant of the past (which they do not remember) and the future (which they do not expect) whilst they sleep. Whereas Augustine has all of us aware of all three all the time.
