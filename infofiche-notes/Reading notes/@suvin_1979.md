## Abstract:


## Notes:
### Introduction:
Discusses the purpose of the work. Justifies the study of science fiction. A bunch of literary criticism words that I don't understand. Initial proposal of Suvin's definition of SF:
> A fictional tale determined by the heegmonic literary device of a locus and/or dramatis personae that 1) are radically or at least significantly different from the empirical times, places, and characters of 'miemetic' or 'naturalist' fiction, but 2) are nonetheless - to the extent that SF differs from other 'fantastic' genres... siultaneously percieved as not impossible within the ... norms of the author's epoch.

(MiÃ©ville's eventual criticism will be that that he ignores fantasy too much.)

Explain's that the book is (obviously) a very limited and small part of a much larger social theory of literature (in studying SF, Suvin is subverting the canon because in his day SF was not high lit. to most scholars).

Uses the word cognition a lot.
### Estrangement and Cognition
- Science fiction as estrangement: A literary genre/tradition that serves to show us our recognizable norms but make them appear strange. Same as what Brecht was trying to do with his theatre (you know what Brechtian alienation is via Stewart Lee! - which it turns out he was trying to do in imitation of a scientist's disinterested gaze which reveals shocking principles underlying basic motions - how unreasonable the motion of the pendulum, or the bending of space with respect to energy).
- Science fiction as cognition: so this is a keyword from the Marxist tradition Suvin works in. Basically means thinking about the world (with fiction) in such a way that includes the idea that the world can be changed through conscious action, influenced by past events. Marx's idea that "men get to make history, but do not choose which history they get to make... ghost of the past haunts blah blah blah".
- Method: SF takes off from a fictional hypothesis and develops it with a totalising ("scientific") rigour.

### The problem of Delineation
Suvin delineates SF from fantasy and other fiction by looking at its relationship to the 'zero world' - the author's empirical experience, and whether or not it is cognitive. Which Suvin again doesn't explain very well but its whatever SF has in common with naturalistic fiction, materialist philosophy and so on. All think about the world in such a way that treats it *as* something that one can think about. 

In contrast to non-naturalistic fiction, in which the world itself might be predisposed for or against the characters (think either pathetic fallacy or  hero ethics), science fiction and naturalistic fiction (its non-estranged cousin), treat the characters' outcomes as products of their relationships with other characters, or coming from inward action and not from "the way things are meant to be". If that makes sense. A good phrase Suvin uses is that in cognitive fiction there is a difference between *physics and ethics*. The physical arrangement does not influence the ethics of the story, and vice versa. They are independent, except perhaps in metaphor, but you can argue about that.

So SF is estranged and cognitive. Naturalistic novels (if there is such a thing) are cognitive and non-estranged - similar to the zero world -, then there's non-cognitive and non-estranged which is just not very good stories tbh and then there's non-cognitive and non-estranged which is fantasy, which Suvin is mean about - fantasy *can* be cognitive.

### Utopia
A genre closely related to SF, and occasionalyl even identical. Suvin adresses other peoples' definitions and, as expect, finds problems with them all. One of his main problems is that a lot of writers treat Utopian works as *descriptions* IE they describe something that already exists, whereas Suvin argues the Utopian novel or whatever *is* the Utopia. The novel doesn't describe it, it creates it. And then you have to watch out how you express the idea of 'better' in order to avoid accidentally including treatises on heaven and so on, and also deal with the fact that Utopias only make sense in their historic context (Moore's Utopia is not, really, because of its attitude towards women). 

In the end, he comes up with the definition of: 
> Utopia is the verbal construction of a particular quasi-human community where sociopolitical institutions, norms, and individual relationships are organised according to a more perfect principle than in the author's community, this construction being based on estrangement arising out of an alternative historical hypothesis.

So to Suvin a Utopia has a few key features:
1) It is created by the work, it is a verbal *construction* of something and not a description of something that already exists. Verbal construction and not novel because typical Utopian works have a number of distinctions from novels e.g., are far more allegorical,
2) Better relative to the author's times and community,
3) Alternative historical hypothesis, to exclude heavens, perfect worlds from the get-go and so on. A Utopia is a *project*, rather than a description. 
In short, Suvin demands a utopia be cognitive.

Then goes on to describe how a Utopia is estrangement, oh look its a sub-genre of SF that's nice.

### SF and Novum
Novum appears to be a literary criticism word for "the new or novel", but not just for SF! Obviously a significant piece of SF's novum is defined, for Suvin, as enabling cognition and being somehow estranged from the author's reality, but novums can exist more widely. 

I think a translation into common speech would be "premise".

Anyway he judges sci-fi (I think rightly) by how interesting and transformative their novum is, and how well they explore it.

## Extracts
Then it turned into a history book and I stopped taking notes. I am going to jot down good quotes from the first few chapters though. Here goes.

"Rather, it \[SF\] should be defined as a fictiona tale determined by the hegemonic literary device of a *locus* and/or *dramatis personae* that (1) are *radically or at least signficantly different from the empirical times, places, and characters* of "mimetic" or "naturalist" fiction, but (2) are nonetheless - to the extent that SF differs from other "fantastic" genres, that is, ensembles of fictional tales without empirical validation - simultaneously percieved as *not impossible* within the cognitive (cosmological and anthropological) norms of the author's epoch." (Preface 2.1) "developed oxymoron"

Chapter 2, 2.3 is where he is his meanest about fantasy. "Fossilised fragments of reasoning are used to inculate irrationality, and the social energy of readers is expended on Witches' Sabbaths instead of focusing it on the causes for our alienating, murderous, and stultifying existences: the power structures holding back the hominization of the sapiens, the true demonology of war and market breeding pride and prejudice. ... \[SF\] is at its worst, at its most alienated and alienating, when it honors the parasitism and vampirism of fantasy." 

Chapter 3. 3 "Utopia is the verbal construction of a particular quasi-human community where socioplotical institutions, norms, and individual relationships are organized according to a more perfect principle than in the author's community, this construction being based on estrangement arising out of an alternative historical hypothesis." What does estrangement mean in a Marxist context?

As above. "If utopia is, philosophically, a method rather than a state,"

Chapter 3. 5 (The ending is the best bit of this chapter.) "All imaginable intelligent life, including ours, can be organized more or less perfectly." \[Utopia\] "is not hypostasis of the Holy Ghost, the *Zeitgeist*, or what-not, but a literary genre induced from a set of man-made books within a man-made history."

Chapter 4. "SF *is distinguished by the narrative dominance or hegemony of a fictional "novum" (novelty, innovation) validated by cognitive logic*."

The whole of chapter 4. section 1.1 which is very good prose about the relationship between the novum and empirical reality and history.

4.1.1 again, \[the cognition involved in SF cannot be tested in a lab but\] "it *can* be methodically developed against the background of a body of already existing cognitions, or at the very least as a "mental experiment" following accepted scientific, that is cognitative, logic."

4.2.6 has a good section about how the novum relates to plot.
