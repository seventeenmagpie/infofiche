# Battle of the Liguist Mages by Scotto Moore
Language-as-virus. Phonemic analysis taken to the extreme. Some dodgy exposition (dialogue as a whole feels weird). Quite weird. Good(?)

Strongest liguistic relativity: power morphemes affect cognition "at runtime" because there's aliens "punctuation marks" inhabiting your brain, that make language possible.

Everyone is introduced with a twitter-bio like sentence: pronouns, race, occupation. It's kinda jarring but nifty once you realise that's what's going on.
