\par
This is a weird piece. I think the author is showing off how much colonial studies lit. theory and philosophy of language they’ve read and are trying to synthesize it all, which is cool but I have no idea how it works.
\par
Additionally I think they misinterpret the novel in several places, most notably ignoring the fact that the Ariekei first use Avice as a simile by their own desire to and secondly that they are at least as much the instigator in learning referential language as Avice is. As she says, the Absurd have already learned to point, that crucial step, and Spanish Dancer and friends’ own commitment to working out how to lie \emph{themselves} is too important to be ignored, but is. Weirdly Alexander manages to remove any agency at all from the Ariekei. 
\par
ALSO because apparently I’m firing shots, Alexander weakens the Breman’s plan with EzRa from (my paraphrase) “making you into a proper colony, destroying your independent systems within a few generations for which we assigned you a specialist governor” (which \emph{Avice actually spells out}) to “checking your own ambassador’s powers”. I don’t know why this is ignored.
\par
Yeah it was a weird read, though I don’t find philosophy of language particularly comprehensible anyway.

  abstract = {Linguistic research on fictional constructed language (conlang) in video game dominantly employs an approach mimetically designed for fictions and films namely a priori and a posteriori. We argue that a priori and a posteriori are unable to comprehensively analyze the relationship between fictional conlangs with game elements. This research aims at constructing a new taxonomy on fictional conlang design approach that adheres specifically to video game. To do so, first, we analyze 62 game titles with 94 fictional conlangs to prove that a priori and a posteriori display deficiencies in pointing their relationship with video game elements. The next step is constructing a taxonomy based on the integration of Crystal’s notion on ludic linguistics, language studies for playful purposes, and Aarseth’s textonomy, the study on how texts are accessed. The research findings indicate that a priori and a posteriori fail to classify 29 fictional conlangs into either category and to indicate the relationship between the conlangs with game elements. In response to this failure, we construct a taxonomy consisting of three approaches namely interpretive, explorative, and configurative. These three approaches are able to indicate a structural relationship between fictional game conlangs, game genres, and the immersion level of the players and to patch the weaknesses a priori and a posteriori taxonomy has. Linguists, departing from this new taxonomy, might cooperate with game designers to design comprehensive conlangs, specifically designed for video games, which conform and correspond to the game genres and immersion levels.},

Although this view may have fallen into disrepute in the field of linguistics, its influence, the Whorfianism, has been the number one showcase in science fiction works that somehow approach language, and more specifically, invented languages. This paper uses Ted Chiang’s award-winning novella Story of your life (1998) and its filmic adaptation Arrival (2016) directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Eric Heisserer as a case study to investigate this literary phenomenon. The considerations of Guy Deutscher (2010), Stockwell (2006) and Ria Cheyne (2008), as well as the authors’ own viewpoints, are vitally important for that. The result is a speculative and comparative analysis that contributes to a better understanding of the frequent connexion of science fiction, glossopoesis and Whorfianism.},

  abstract = {Feminists have long argued that sexist language can have real world consequences for gender relations and the relative status of men and women, and recent research suggests that grammatical gender can shape how people interpret the world around them along gender lines (Boroditsky 2009). Although others have theorized about the connection between grammatical gender in language and societal gender equality (Stahlberg et al. 2007), the current work tests this link empirically by examining differences in gender equality between countries with gendered, natural gender, and genderless language systems. Of the 111 countries investigated, our findings suggest that countries where gendered languages are spoken evidence less gender equality compared to countries with other grammatical gender systems. Furthermore, countries where natural gender languages are spoken demonstrate greater gender equality, which may be due to the ease of creating gender symmetric revisions to instances of sexist language.},
