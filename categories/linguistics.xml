&lt;p&gt;This book ended up on my list for two reasons: a) it has the word linguist in the title and b) it was getting talked about a lot on social media, with adjectives like "wacky", "surreal" and "what on earth is happening". Safe to say, I was intrigued, and now I've finally read it. The short and boring version of this discussion is: "this book uses a very strong version of linguistic relativity and universality to power its magic system and metaphysics, but linguistics isn't key to the plot or characterisations beyond that", that would be a injustice against a surprisingly deep and involved book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion contains some spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages by Scotto Moore&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the metaphysics and Maddy, so beware if you are still reading. I do not touch the plot. So, without further ado, lets explore the weird world of &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
