&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; is Andy Weir's 2021 novel of alien caused apocalypse and first contact. And, as a first contact novel, it is partially concerned with matters of communication. Below the fold we'll consider how Weir constructs his fictional language, as well as how he uses it in characterisation, especially how he treats the language in such a way as to &lt;em&gt;minimise&lt;/em&gt; alienation. Spoilers for the whole plot below!&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the first!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book ended up on my list for two reasons: a) it has the word linguist in the title and b) it was getting talked about a lot on social media, with adjectives like "wacky", "surreal" and "what on earth is happening". Safe to say, I was intrigued, and now I've finally read it. The short and boring version of this discussion is: "this book uses a very strong version of linguistic relativity and universality to power its magic system and metaphysics, but linguistics isn't key to the plot or characterisations beyond that", that would be a injustice against a surprisingly deep and involved book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion contains some spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages by Scotto Moore&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the metaphysics and Maddy, so beware if you are still reading. I do not touch the plot. So, without further ado, lets explore the weird world of &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Myers</title><link>https://infofiche.uk/posts/aliens-and-linguists-review/</link><dc:creator>Seventeen Magpie</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was beginning this project of learning about science-fictional linguistics, one of the tasks we had to do was review the literature in the field - preliminary research before the real work started. Fortunately, I had mercifully few resources to hand as there is exactly one published academic monograph on this subject (that I could find). That book is &lt;em&gt;Aliens and Linguists&lt;/em&gt; by Walter E. Myers and it was published in 1982 (so perhaps its time for someone to write a more modern one). I had a hard time getting a copy, but eventually managed and, whilst it didn't inform much of that project it is worth discussing anyway, at least so there's something more informative about it on the internet for the next person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More below the fold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- five minute review --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrier is a comic by Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin, with Muntsa Vicente. It is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/barrier"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; (pay what you want!) and its well worth a read for when my descriptions are sub-par. The thing that caught my eye, aside from it being an "unconventional drama about violence, language and illegal immigration," was the fact its a Spanish/English bilingual comic, and since I can read Spanish, I decided to give it a go. Spoilers beyond!&lt;/p&gt;
