It contains one of the most interesting and well thought out fictional languages I've read, and this is the rare novel that is very much &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; its own fictional language, rather than simply being written in the context of a fictional language. It has similarities in that regard with Suzette Haden Elgin's &lt;em&gt;Native Tongue&lt;/em&gt; (...also in having a special lineage of translators raised for the task). It's also a fantastic read and I found a few things to say about it (less than usual), which &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can read about if you join me below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

(September 2/2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; is Andy Weir's 2021 novel of alien caused apocalypse and first contact. And, as a first contact novel, it is partially concerned with matters of communication. Below the fold we'll consider how Weir constructs his fictional language, as well as how he uses it in characterisation, especially how he treats the language in such a way as to &lt;em&gt;minimise&lt;/em&gt; alienation. Spoilers for the whole plot below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrier is a comic by Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin, with Muntsa Vicente. It is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/barrier"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; (pay what you want!) and its well worth a read for when my descriptions are sub-par. The thing that caught my eye, aside from it being an "unconventional drama about violence, language and illegal immigration," was the fact its a Spanish/English bilingual comic, and since I can read Spanish, I decided to give it a go. Spoilers beyond!&lt;/p&gt;
