It contains one of the most interesting and well thought out fictional languages I've read, and this is the rare novel that is very much &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; its own fictional language, rather than simply being written in the context of a fictional language. It has similarities in that regard with Suzette Haden Elgin's &lt;em&gt;Native Tongue&lt;/em&gt; (...also in having a special lineage of translators raised for the task). It's also a fantastic read and I found a few things to say about it (less than usual), which &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can read about if you join me below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

(September 2/2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; is Andy Weir's 2021 novel of alien caused apocalypse and first contact. And, as a first contact novel, it is partially concerned with matters of communication. Below the fold we'll consider how Weir constructs his fictional language, as well as how he uses it in characterisation, especially how he treats the language in such a way as to &lt;em&gt;minimise&lt;/em&gt; alienation. Spoilers for the whole plot below!&lt;/p&gt;

September 1/2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book ended up on my list for two reasons: a) it has the word linguist in the title and b) it was getting talked about a lot on social media, with adjectives like "wacky", "surreal" and "what on earth is happening". Safe to say, I was intrigued, and now I've finally read it. The short and boring version of this discussion is: "this book uses a very strong version of linguistic relativity and universality to power its magic system and metaphysics, but linguistics isn't key to the plot or characterisations beyond that", that would be a injustice against a surprisingly deep and involved book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion contains some spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages by Scotto Moore&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the metaphysics and Maddy, so beware if you are still reading. I do not touch the plot. So, without further ado, lets explore the weird world of &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Linguist Mages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From the detailed grammar of Quenya to the more philosophical Entish, his linguistic creations serve to add depth to the setting, and interiority to the peoples he has populate it. Language is everywhere in &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, even invisibly. In this blog post I'm going to explore a few of the ways Tolkien goes about using fictional languages in his work. Join me beneath the fold to read more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello readers! Wellcome to the second SFF linguistics blog post, this time about alienation and assimilation in &lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt; (Arkady Martine, 2019) is a political thriller space opera. It is also a powerful story about assimilation and alienation in relation to an alluring and hostile culture. Martine does this by endearing us with the viewpoint protaganist, Mahit, and skilfully showing the forces of alienation and assimilation she experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the (many) tools Martine uses to achieve this is language. Mahit does not speak the language of the Empire, Teixcalaan, (the empire and the language share the name) natively; She learnt it with care and dedication and each of her encounters with it is also an encounter with the alien, which she shares with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrier is a comic by Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin, with Muntsa Vicente. It is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/barrier"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; (pay what you want!) and its well worth a read for when my descriptions are sub-par. The thing that caught my eye, aside from it being an "unconventional drama about violence, language and illegal immigration," was the fact its a Spanish/English bilingual comic, and since I can read Spanish, I decided to give it a go. Spoilers beyond!&lt;/p&gt;
