&lt;p&gt;Hello readers! Wellcome to the second SFF linguistics blog post, this time about alienation and assimilation in &lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Memory Called Empire&lt;/em&gt; (Arkady Martine, 2019) is a political thriller space opera. It is also a powerful story about assimilation and alienation in relation to an alluring and hostile culture. Martine does this by endearing us with the viewpoint protaganist, Mahit, and skilfully showing the forces of alienation and assimilation she experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the (many) tools Martine uses to achieve this is language. Mahit does not speak the language of the Empire, Teixcalaan, (the empire and the language share the name) natively; She learnt it with care and dedication and each of her encounters with it is also an encounter with the alien, which she shares with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barrier is a comic by Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin, with Muntsa Vicente. It is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/barrier"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; (pay what you want!) and its well worth a read for when my descriptions are sub-par. The thing that caught my eye, aside from it being an "unconventional drama about violence, language and illegal immigration," was the fact its a Spanish/English bilingual comic, and since I can read Spanish, I decided to give it a go. Spoilers beyond!&lt;/p&gt;
