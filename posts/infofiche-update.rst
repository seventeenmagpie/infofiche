Hello! I'm Seventeen Magpie and I'm taking this post to outline my plans for the coming year and establish some things. It's mine.

Firstly, this is actually the second post. I've already put out a discussion of the :doc:`language barriers in *Barrier* <alien-language-in-barrier-by-vaughan-and-martin>` so you can read that already. That is the kind of thing this blog is concerned with - SFF and linguistics and how they are used to tell stories.

Secondly, I've started a list of 'has reads'. It's available on the sidebar. I'm deliberately not reviewing every book on there because I won't enjoy doing that. The list is mostly for my own interest to see what I read, when, how much &c. but I expect it will be useful if you're wondering - ever - 'has Seventeen Magpie read X?' and it can save you asking me.

Thirdly, I have a tenuous plan for what posts you have coming up (not in this order):

- How fictional languages are used in *A Memory Called Empire* to explore assimilation and alienation,
- Neopronouns in *A Half Built Garden* (when that book comes out),
- The start of a theory series where I outline my approach to fictional language based criticism and establish key terms,
- A love letter to *Outer Wilds*,

Fourthly, timing. I'm going to aim for a post a month, so you've had your post for February and the next one - probably from that list but I haven't decided which - will come around the start of March.

I look forward to seeing you then! Take care.
