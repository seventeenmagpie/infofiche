    <p>Hello there! One year and ten blog posts later and it's January again. As the days gradually get longer but no warmer, I'm looking back at the previous year of blogging and see what I think worked, what didn't and what I'm going to differently to continue this project into 2023.</p>
<p>This post will have a few parts: (1) what's my process been for the last year, (2) evaluating the results of that, (3) what's my process for 2023 going to be and (4) any other business.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>So, how have I written this blog this year? I am slightly embarrassed by how poor a process this is but here you go:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Finish reading the book in question about two days before the publication date,</p></li>
<li><p>Write the draft of the post the day before publication,</p></li>
<li><p>Edit/proofread and post the day of publication.</p></li>
<li><p>That's it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see it's not fantastic. When I was going over all my posts of this year, the biggest thing I remember being the problem was a time crunch, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I like to read books that aren't always related to this project, so after publication I would normally read one or two unrelated books and then start on next month's book in the week the month changed. But reading for leisure to a deadline is hard, especially now that I have a university workload which means I might want to read a book for my course or just not want to feel the pressure in my leisure reading. Then after I pushed to get the book read, I would have another time crunch to write and publish.</p>
<p>This means that nearly all the blog posts, definitely the last six, had about three hours' writing in them, which is a very short time to write what I want to be a) good prose and b) well reasoned arguments. This is the key contributor to my perceived low quality for many of the posts. Nearly all of them have parts I like, and I think my analysis is broadly correct, but they aren't beautiful essays that I would be proud to show someone which is really what I want. If I were at the start of 2021 when I had to research fictional languages for a school project, and I came across this blog as it is now, I would <em>still</em> think "oh, I can do better than that". In other words this blog has failed to fill the niche I wanted it to; namely to satisfy myself.</p>
<p>So how am I going to improve? Well the big issue is easing the time pressure. I can see two ways of doing this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reading the book at the <em>start</em> of the month and writing about it in the weeks leading up to the start of the next month. This gives me much more time to think, and more time to write.</p></li>
<li><p>Publish less often, probably to no fixed schedule. Perhaps seasonally (spring, summer, autumn, winter for me).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The latter of these is what I'm going to do, because it gives me more room to change the focus of my energy from other projects/my studies to this one, and gives me more time to do my favourite part of Infofiche, which is research. I think having an idea, going and finding an article or book about it and using that in your writing is incredibly satisfying and I want to do it more. Ultimately, Infofiche <em>can't</em> be the highest priority thing in my life, because there are more important things. I need to ensure it's treated properly as a hobby and that means making sure I get enough play and satisfaction out of it that it doesn't drain the energy I need for work.</p>
<p>So what that means for you - my imagined reader who may not even exist (I have limited statistics, but I think I'm the only person who reads this blog) - is fewer posts but hopefully in exchange the posts will be longer and better. I want them to be longer essay pieces, perhaps including multiple books and other research and I want them to have a coherent arc and theme to them. This is probably moving away from the conventions of the 'blog' format and really using a 'blog' as a carrier for longer-form essay writing - like Ada Palmer's exurbe, which feels like comparing oneself to Athena but there you go.</p>
<p>The challenge with this pace of publication is motivating myself over the months rather than the week. A time crunch is good for making me do the thing but not for making me do it well, I think I need to let the act of research and writing itself be fun enough that I can do it without pushing myself particularly hard. Part of this will be writing a concrete plan for each essay so I have small tasks to keep doing.</p>
<p>I'd like to come back to that point about research I made above. When I started this project I envisioned using it as an excuse to learn about formal linguistics. This was a complete failure because (a) in my arrogance I thought that was easier to do than it is, especially in conjunction with all the things I try to learn and (b) sff very rarely has anything to do with formal linguistics. Philosophy of language, yes, but that's not what I intended. This is sad because formal linguistics, the little I know, is really interesting and hopefully, the longer lead times I'm giving myself means I have the room to work more on this goal. Perhaps I will also read some philosophical texts to help understand what the sff referring to, but again the long times means this will no longer feel like a barrier I have to overcome quickly enough, but part of longer term research.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the theme more generally. Infofiche is  always going to be a blog with its centre of mass on sff and language, but there are other things I want to talk about, and perhaps even unrelated things that I might know about. This blog will never be a "kitchen sink blog", and I fully expect every piece I write to have something to do with sff, but it may be that I explore other directions than language. Ultimately this will give me the opportunity when writing to write about what I think a book has the most room to be written about, rather than having to go: "This book isn't really doing anything with language. Drat." (The additional time helps with this too).</p>
<p>There are other things I intend to do differently in the next year. I resolve to punctuate brackets properly and publish 90% fewer typos. Hopefully having a lead time longer than a week means I can make use of beta readers and gather feedback before publishing. And I want to "grow my readership", which would normally make me cringe but the simple fact remains that, as far as I know (again: I don't use any trackers or analytics on this website), I am the only regular reader of this blog. That feels really lonely! I'd like to talk to other people about this stuff, I'd like to solicit criticism and feedback, I'd like to not feel like I'm writing into the void.</p>
<p>To do this latter thing, I need to (<em>shudder</em>) put myself out there. The twitter account failed pretty miserably, mostly because I don't use twitter habitually and also because that website is god-awful. I've been liking what I've been seeing from mastodon so far, especially wandering.social, except that instance is invites only and I'm not able to get in. For the time being, I'm on hackyderm.io as @yarrharr. Additionally there is a discord server appearing in the sidebar (as well as removing the twitter), just in case that's where my readers would rather hang.</p>
<p>There's a few other bits and pieces to go here so rapid fire because this is long enough:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Seventeen Magpie isn't actually a canonical Teixcaalanli name, because magpies are animate. Now the reason for this is I'm a foreigner to the empire who did not understand this, but it's quite tedious to have to explain that, so it may well be that this name changes again in the near future. (Perhaps to a Utopian name?)</p></li>
<li><p>The blog looks kinda naff, the sidebar is too small, the colours boring, there's too much white space. The theme needs reworking. Ultimately, I know what I want my website to look like (it includes a rainbow), I just need to work out how to implement it. I can tell this will take much more effort than I expect so I don't know when it will happen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And that's all. I'm really excited to keep working on this project, to do more with it and ultimately write pieces that I'm prouder of. I'm currently having a lot of thoughts about anarchism and <em>Terra Ignota</em>, and I've also heard Ruthana Emrys' <em>A Half-Built Garden</em> is exactly my jam. Let's see where the books lead! I wish you all an excellent 2023 with yuor loved ones, spent on work which satisfies you and leisure which nourishes. :)</p>
