.. introduction
.. RK. WHAT IS YOUR GOAL WITH THIS. well, thank u for asking. i want to explain structuralism and then explain absent paradigm theory (all examples should be taken from TLT) and THEN i'm going to talk about how GOOD TLT is at doing absent paradigm-y things.

.. structuralism (brief, BRIEF semiology tangent) + how it applies to non SFF fiction.

.. wat if we don't know the thing? -> absent paradigms

.. THE LOCKED TOMB IS AMAZINGGGGG.
