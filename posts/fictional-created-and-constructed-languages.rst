Despite the impression given by conlanging YouTube, constructed languages actually form a minority of fictional languages. This bias results in a number of important effects being ignored, and weakens the analysis possible. Before we discuss those effects, we first need to understand what is meant by constructed languages, created languages and fictional languages. Join me below the fold to find out more!

.. TEASER_END

Hello dear readers! Today I am blogging about some theory behind my analyses, mostly as an attempt to put a system into words for others to understand (something which I have little practice of). Please treat my theorising with rigour and kindness. I am also unaccostomed to writing in an accesibly formal, explanatory style. With those disclaimers out of the way, we begin.

Section 1: Please Provide your Own Title
----------------------------------------

Many more novels containing fictional languages are published than grammars for those languages. This is partly because grammars are hard to sell at the best of times; the real grammars of fictional languages are a harder sell still. This is also because *most fictional languages never have a written grammar* at all. Rarely even are any notes on morphology, syntax, phonology left in the author's hand. All those things that lovers of language love, that those of us who pore over tables of declensions for Quenyan adore, that persuade us to traipse through websites fossilized in the styles of the early 00s, are absent.

A few fictional languages are fortunate enough, usually when being adapted for screen, to have a professional construct a more substantial grammar than the author did. Gaps are filled and things made consisent so that plausible, natural, new dialogue can be written. Famously, the entire grammar of Dothraki as featured in the TV show was inferred from two lines of it in the whole of the Game of Thrones novels [CITE]. The key word here is *constructed*. George R. R. Martin never sat down to write a grammar of Dothraki himself because he didn't want to and didn't need to [actually it might have been High Valarin rather than Dothraki. Go check Seventeen].

The same is true for the languages spoken on Gethen (*Left Hand of Darkness*), we recieve a few words in Karhide and [that other language], but Le Guin herself has said she never had any more detail than a list of words, now lost. *A Memory Called Empire* contains fictional language and many words of it; there is an entire glossary at the back, but whether the language was constructed beyond ensuring a consistent phonology and some morphology and possibly etymology is unknown (Hi, Ms Martine. If the case is otherwise, I would love to know.) There are no whole sentences in Teixcalaan, or anything beyond loanwords in an otherwise English text. Tolkien's Ent language is similarly vaguely presented. We know it takes them a looooong time to say anything, that they learnt speech from the Elves (presumably the tongues are related) and there are a couple of words recorded in various places, but grammatical detail like how they form their long sentence-words are unknown. These languages were not constructed.

Yet I think most of the discourse in the conlanging community revolves around languages with a grammar - observe the contents of Conlang Critic or Biblaridion's  videos which primarily showcase a conlang or use conlanging as a way to teach linguistics. The issues with both of these approaches is that they ignore the vital role of fictional languages within their fictional contexts. They cannot talk about what they show us of the world (they do, occasionally), or how the fictional languages contribute to the themes of the novel, or the emotional beats - all important things that all authors think about, and that authors use fictional languages to achieve. In my mind, the people who write about the grammar of Tolkien's languages should be the same as the people who talk about the worldbuilding they present, or how they influence the reader's experience. These things should not be separated.

In short, I argue that the study fictional languages should include literary criticism and vice versa. An unpopular opinion, I suspect, since most discussion of fictional languages prides itself on its linguistic reality and admitting that this isn't actually the most important may be difficult for some, but I think that making it the most important feature of a fictional language obscures other features, limits the space of criticism ("the language is like this because the author misunderstood linguistics" vs "the language is like this because the author wanted to make a certain point, linguistics be damned here"), and prevents very interesting and important works being acessed and analysed for their fictional languages.

.. argue that more
.. explain why it is an issue
.. explain the need to remember con and cre languages as *methodologies*
.. then go (which I guess leaves nothing to call the constructed and created languages which *aren't* fictional, whoops)
.. cite Tolkien's 'sketch' terminology for precedence.
.. introduce key papers (these ideas are also expressed in the academic literature... in these papers here:)
.. corolary on 'seriously, what do we call the non-fictional languages now?
