This page is effectively a reading list of explicitly linguistic SFF and also non-fiction that I've found useful in the course of writing this blog. If its linked to, then I've read and written about it.

Fiction:
========
- *Battle of the Linguist Mages* by Scotto Moore,
- *A Half-Built Garden* by Ruthanna Emrys,
- :doc:`*Barrier* by Brian K. Vaughan, Marcos Martin and Muntsa Vicente <alien-language-in-barrier-by-vaughan-and-martin>`,
- :doc:`*A Memory Called Empire* by Arkady Martine (2019) <language-alienation-and-assimilation-in-a-memory>`,
- *The Story of your Life* by Ted Chiang,
- *Native Tongue* by Suzette Haden Elgin,
- *Triton* by Samuel R. Delany,

Non-fiction:
============
(A lot of these are TBR, and for SFF criticism, not just linguistics)

- :doc:`*Aliens and Linguists* by Walter E. Myers <aliens-and-linguists-walter-e-myers-review>`,
- *The Jewel Hinged Jaw* by Samuel R. Delany,
