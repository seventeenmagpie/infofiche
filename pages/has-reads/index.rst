.. description: A list of all the books I've read that I've remembered to record here.
.. type: text

This is a list of my reading habits since starting this blog. I'm doing it entirely for my own gratification and ego since I like watching lists grow and todo lists diminish (this has been on my todolist) and because I hope it will be interesting to see. I'm not going to talk about every book here, since this is deliberately not a review blog, but if books are so interesting they get posts related to them, they'll be linked here too.

A note on how I read: I typically have three books on the go at once. One book which I read before bed and whenever I like to, a second (e)Book which I read whilst eating breakfast or if I can't bring the physical book but do have my ereader and a third book that I read on the computer when procrastinating/breaking from work. This third book is usually a graphic work of some sort.

I'm not providing copious bibliographic information because I don't think thats important and title and year is enough to find most editions. Finally, this list started in February and my memory is poor so pre feb, watch out. Without futher ado, here are the books I read in 2022 (most recent to least).
