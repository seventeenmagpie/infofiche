This is a list of my reading habits since starting this blog. I'm doing it entirely for my own gratification and ego since I like watching lists grow and todo lists diminish (this has been on my todolist). I hope it will be interesting to see. I'm not going to talk about every book here, since this is deliberately not a review blog, but if books are so interesting they get posts related to them, they'll be linked here too.

A note on how I read: I typically have three books on the go at once. One book which I read before bed and whenever I like to, a second (e)Book which I read whilst eating breakfast or if I can't bring the physical book but do have my ereader and a third book that I read on the computer when procrastinating/breaking from work. This third book is usually a graphic work of some sort. Stars mean book is highly recomended/notable.

Finally, this list started in February and my memory is poor so pre feb, watch out. Without futher ado, here are the books I read in 2022 (most recent to least).
