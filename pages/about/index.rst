Hello. It is January in the year 2022 and I've spent the past six months on a school project that has made me realise how much I love science fiction and fantasy and linguistics and how I have a lot more to say than can reasonably fit in a 5000 word essay - hence this blog!

The name of this blog is taken from Arkady Martine's *A Memory Called Empire* which was the book which started of that project and, over the last few years, become incredibly important to me. The word itself appears to be Dutch and means 'info sheet', but in her world it becomes the future's holographic letters. I just love the tactile sensation of having the infofiche stick and cracking it open and watching all these words spill out around you - that's what reading a good novel is like - and I decided it was an apt name that I can hopefully live up to.

You can expect to find discussions of science fiction and fantasy, especially how it pertains to linguistics and conlanging (and cre-langing! Mustn't forget about created languages!).

Be kind out there.
